## Gear Setup
- **Telescope**: William Optics ZenithStar 61 (ZS61)  
- **Camera**: Canon EOS R  
- **Mount**: Sky-Watcher Star Adventurer 2i (WiFi)  
- **Filter / Accessories**: N/A  

## Target
- **Object**: Andromeda Galaxy (M31)  
- **Integration (planned)**: ~10h  
- **Integration (actual)**: ~5h  
- **Exposure length (planned)**: 130s  
- **Exposure length (actual)**: 70s  

## First Light Experience
This was my very first night running my own astrophotography rig.  
The William Optics ZS61 paired with the Canon EOS R gave me a wide field that framed M31 perfectly.  

I set out hoping for 10 hours of integration, but the session ended early due to clouds rolling in. Even with just 5 hours of data, I was able to pull out detail in the dust lanes and the galaxy’s core.

## Processing Notes
I stacked the data in **Siril**, did gradient removal, background extraction, and stretched the image. Final touches and color balance were done in **Photoshop**.  

## Reflections
- Guiding/tracking on the Star Adventurer 2i worked well at ~70s exposures.  
- Focus on the ZS61 was sharp and easy to dial in.  
- First time handling calibration frames — my flats could be improved.  

## Next Steps
- Capture more data on M31 (ideally full 10h session).  
- Try longer exposures (130s) once polar alignment is nailed.  
- Work on better calibration frames for cleaner stacking.
