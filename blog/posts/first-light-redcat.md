Last night I finally pointed the **RedCat** at Cygnus under a hazy sky.  
Even with a short integration (~45 minutes) the star shapes looked great.

### Notes
- Guiding hovered ~0.8" RMS with a light breeze  
- Gain 100, offset 50, -10°C  
- Bortle 5–6, PM2.5 around 12 µg/m³

### Next time
- New flats (tilted dust)  
- Try 180s subs if the wind cooperates
